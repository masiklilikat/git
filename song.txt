Crawling down
From high hopes to the ground
Trouble sings along

In my heart and soul
A giant in the room
I left him long ago, following you

Wind heavy on the ground
A cloak before the moon
I guess I've never known
Someone like you

Falling down
From high hopes to the ground
There's no way out

In my heart and soul
A giant in the room
We took the walk alone
And now we are through

Wind heavy on the ground
A cloak before the moon
I guess I've never known
Someone like you
